               <h2>Writer Of the Month  </h2>
               <p>Our HND assignment experts are no less talented than the other departments we house.</p>
               <p>So, when you’re choosing one for your disciple, know you will get an expert who is fully dedicated to the job and has all the incentives to deliver the best to you.</p>
               <p>One of the biggest such incentives we offer to our professionals for doing a good job is choosing the best writer every month.</p>
               <p>We host this competition internally to make sure our experts are always motivated and have a good reward to look forward to when they are chosen as “the one” for the month. This month, Lindsey took the crown in the HND department. Let’s hear it from her!</p>
               <p>“It’s been such an honour to work with my fellow team, who has been amazing ever since I joined. My clients have been a delight to work with, too! I look forward to keep helping HND students as best as I can.”</p>
